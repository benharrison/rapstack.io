            <div id="overview">
                The <strong>RAP stack</strong> is an architectural pattern that utilizes <strong>REST APIs</strong> for sophisticated back-end functionality, while making their functionality easy to use through a thin-client <strong>PHP</strong> interface.
                An alternative to LAMP, this approach greatly reduces the amount of code in a PHP application, while empowering Web Designers & Software Engineers to focus on their respective strengths.

            <h1>Philosophies, Principles, &amp; Motivations</h1>

            <ul>
                <li>The user-interface is not <em>the application</em>, but rather a small module within a larger system.</li>
                <li>Systems can (and in many cases should) have more than one interface. For example: mobile, admin panel, tech support, heads up display, and a test harness to name a few.</li>
                <li>The user-interface should be more of a Web Design Project rather than a Software Engineering Project.</li>
                <li>Less is more when it comes to business logic existing in presentation layers.</li>
                <li>PHP still has a purpose, and there are lots of talented web designers ready and able to contribute.</li>
                <li>Newer isn't always better. Just because the eleventy-billionth Javascript framework that was just released claims to help you build apps faster, easier, and more reliably doesn't necessarily mean it will work as well as it sounds.</li>
                <li>Artists who learn to code are always better designers than Programmers who learn to design.</li>
                <li>The end product is infinitely more important than the tools used to build it.</li>
            </ul>

            <h1>Bottom-up Technical Design / Top-down UI Design</h1>

            <p>
                Since the user-interface is <em>not</em> the application, this pattern actually starts at the opposite end of the stack.
            </p>

            <p>
                Back-end API development can be built, tested, demonstrated, and proven to scale to internal engineering teams with or without the need of a user-interface.
            </p>

            <h1>Problems This Pattern Attempts to Avoid</h1>

            <ul>
                <li>Open-source vendor lock-in</li>
                <li>Deceptively easy one-line terminal commands that start a project quickly, but add bloat, unwanted dependencies and restrictions</li>
            </ul>

            <h1>OK great, but PHP? Seriously?</h1>

            <p>
                Yes.
            </p>

                <q>Over the years, my routine might have changed some but my philosophy never did.
                    If something has worked for other greats before, and if something is working for you, why change it up and embrace some new fad?
                    Stick with what works, even if it's unpopular.</q>

            </div>

            <p>
                Much of PHP's reputation is 
                <a href="https://medium.com/@raydollete/php-gets-a-bad-rap-3ab6fce06c4a">actually unfair</a>,
                because it has been the language of choice for lots of poorly written projects.
                In many of those cases, the creators were to blame more than the tool.
                PHP, just like nearly every other technology, has a purpose and serves a specific niche as the right tool for the job.
            </p>

            <p>
                Using this pattern PHP is a minimal tip of the iceberg proxy to the underlying functionality.
            </p>

            <p>
                The RAP stack is largely a counter-response to the ever-changing web development landscape.
                New tools and frameworks are constantly being released, with each making lofty claims that they'll help teams build software better, faster, and more reliably than before.
                While occassionally true, often the claims are too good to be true.

                In the worst case scenarios new technologies can become counterproductive nightmares;
                    decreasing team velocity, adding unnecessary restrictions, binding projects to vendor-lockin, 
                    creating dependencies that are difficult to upgrade, 
                    or simply requiring a paradigm-shift in thinking to accomplish the same thing.
            </p>

            <p>
                This stack provides fundamentally skilled developers a flexible pattern to build quality products on proven technologies.
            </p>

<!--
Not exactly a new technology stack. More of an ideology that combines various proven technologies.
    Your UI is not your application
    Newer isn't always better
Less is more
Clean separation between REST API Software Engineers & Web Designers
    UI is a thin-client piece of a much larger system
Not arrogant enough to say that we're the fastest/best/easiest. Lots of good frameworks exist, and want to co-exist. More a proponent of proven tools and techniques over.

Improved Separation of Concerns between design & development
- Simpler UI empowers web designers to make valuable contributions
- Software Engineers can focus on the hard stuff that really matters

https://medium.com/@raydollete/php-gets-a-bad-rap-3ab6fce06c4a - Poor carpenter blames the tools

what we're against:
- deceptively easy one-line command that does way too much, requires a paradigm shift in thinking, and developing an expertise in a proprietary tool
- open-source vendor lock-in
