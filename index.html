            <h1>Overview</h1>

            <p>
                The <strong>RAP stack</strong> is an architectural pattern that utilizes <strong>REST APIs</strong> for sophisticated back-end functionality, making their functionality easy to use through a thin-client <strong>PHP</strong> interface.
                An alternative to LAMP, this approach greatly reduces the amount of code in a PHP application, while empowering Web Designers & Software Engineers to focus on their respective strengths.
            </p>

            <h1>OK great, but PHP? Seriously?</h1>

            <p>
                If you're a Developer I can sense your judgment already. But if you're willing to give me a short moment of your time I'll explain, and I think I might just be able to win you over.
            </p>

            <p>
                <a href="https://medium.com/@raydollete/php-gets-a-bad-rap-3ab6fce06c4a">PHP's bad reputation is largely unfair</a>,
                because it has been the language of choice for lots of poorly written projects.
                In many of those cases, the creators were to blame more than the tool.
                PHP, just like nearly every other technology, has a purpose and serves a specific niche as the right tool for the job.
            </p>

            <p>
                The RAP stack is largely a counter-response to the ever-changing web development landscape.
                New tools and frameworks are constantly being released, with each making lofty claims that they'll help teams build software better, faster, and more reliably than before.
                While occassionally this might be true, often it isn't. In the worst case scenarios new technologies can even be counterproductive;
                    regressing productivity and adding unnecessary restrictions.
            </p>
            <p>
                This stack provides fundamentally skilled developers a flexible pattern to build quality products on proven technologies.

<!--
Not exactly a new technology stack. More of an ideology that combines various proven technologies.
    Your UI is not your application
    Newer isn't always better
Less is more
Clean separation between REST API Software Engineers & Web Designers
    UI is a thin-client piece of a much larger system
A system can have many UIs: official UI, admin panel, software support tools, development test harness, heads up display, mobile interface, postman collection
PHP still has a purpose
Not arrogant enough to say that we're the fastest/best/easiest. Lots of good frameworks exist, and want to co-exist. More a proponent of proven tools and techniques over.
End product is infinitely more important than the tools used to build it.

Improved Separation of Concerns between design & development
- Simpler UI empowers web designers to make valuable contributions
- Software Engineers can focus on the hard stuff that really matters

https://medium.com/@raydollete/php-gets-a-bad-rap-3ab6fce06c4a - Poor carpenter blames the tools

what we're against:
- deceptively easy one-line command that does way too much, requires a paradigm shift in thinking, and developing an expertise in a proprietary tool
- open-source vendor lock-in
