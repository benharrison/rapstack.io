            <h1>Overview</h1>

            <p>
                The <strong>RAP stack</strong> is an architectural pattern that utilizes <strong>PHP</strong> &amp; <strong>Apache</strong> as a thin-client user-interface over more sophisticated back-end <strong>REST APIs</strong>.
                An alternative to LAMP, this approach greatly reduces the amount of code in a PHP application, while empowering Web Designers & Software Engineers to focus on their respective strengths.
            </p>

<!--
Not exactly a new technology stack. More of an ideology that combines various proven technologies.
Your UI is not your application
Newer isn't always better
Less is more
Clean separation between REST API Software Engineers & Web Designers
UI is a thin-client piece of a much larger system
A system can have many UIs: official UI, admin panel, software support tools, development test harness, heads up display, mobile interface, postman collection
PHP still has a purpose
Not arrogant enough to say that we're the fastest/best/easiest. Lots of good frameworks exist, and want to co-exist. More a proponent of proven tools and techniques over.
End product is infinitely more important than the tools used to build it.

Improved Separation of Concerns between design & development
- Simpler UI empowers web designers to make valuable contributions
- Software Engineers can focus on the hard stuff that really matters

https://medium.com/@raydollete/php-gets-a-bad-rap-3ab6fce06c4a - Poor carpenter blames the tools

what we're against:
- deceptively easy one-line command that does way too much, requires a paradigm shift in thinking, and developing an expertise in a proprietary tool
- open-source vendor lock-in
